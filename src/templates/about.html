    <h1>About the WPI ACM Chapter</h1>
    <h2>History</h2>
	<p>ACM established student chapters to provide an opportunity for students to play a more active role in the Association and its professional activities. By encouraging organization of student chapters on college and university campuses, the Association is able to introduce students to the benefits of professional organization. These benefits include regular meetings that encourage and enhance learning through exchange of ideas among students as well as between established professionals and students. Members of a student chapter may also take advantage of the activities and services provided by ACM, including the lectureship program, student programming and tutorial contests, and the publications program. Student chapters provide an obvious setting for the development and demonstration of leadership capabilities. Finally, students find the various activities of ACM and its student chapters both professionally and socially exciting as well as rewarding.</p>
    <p>Initially, the ACM organizational structure was based solely on individual membership. In 1954, as a result of growth and the wishes of its members, chapters were officially formed. These chapters provided a means for people in a geographical area with a common interest in computing to exchange ideas and sponsor professional activities. Since the recognition of the Dallas-Fort Worth Chapter in 1954 as the first ACM chapter, the number of professional chapters has grown steadily to over 113 today, and they have become an integral part of the ACM organization. Student chapters were authorized by the ACM in 1961; the first was chartered at the University of Southwestern Louisiana.</p>
    <p>Student chapters provide important services to ACM student members and offer a means whereby the ACM can provide scientific information on the industry to other members of the college or university community as well as to the general public. Moreover, professional chapters and student chapters are focal points for feedback from members to the ACM leadership. Finally, ACM Chapters are a training ground for the Association's future leaders. Over one-third of the current members of the ACM Council began their volunteer work with ACM as officers in the chapter system.</p>
